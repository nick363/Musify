# Musify
iOS Music Application

Musify is an iOS Mobile application that allows people to listen and organize their favorite songs based on Genres. 
The first tab allows songs to be played through YouTube and adding a new song requires the YouTube URL extension.

Songs can also be rated from a 1-3 star scale, which is then organized by rating in the second tab.

In the final tab, the Spotify SDK is used to search whatever is inputed into the search box. Then a list of songs will appear and 
can be streamed and played through Spotify.
